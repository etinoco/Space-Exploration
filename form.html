        <h1>The history of Space Exploration</h1>
        <p>During the time that has passed since the launching of the first artificial satellite in 1957, 
        astronauts have traveled to the moon, probes have explored the solar system, and instrume
        nts in space have discovered thousands of planets around other stars.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>We human beings have been venturing into space since October 4, 1957, 
        when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth. 
        This happened during the period of political hostility 
        between the Soviet Union and the United States known as the Cold War.</p>

        <h2>During the 60's</h2>
        <p>During the 1960s, NASA made progress toward President Kennedyâ€™s goal of landing a 
        human on the moon with a program called Project Gemini, in which astronauts tested 
        technology needed for future flights to the moon, and tested their own 
        ability to endure many days in spaceflight.</p>
